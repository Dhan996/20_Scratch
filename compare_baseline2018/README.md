Making plots to compare the baseline2018 and new v1.5 2-snap baseline

* Spatial dithering
* camera rotational dithering
* u-band DDF no longer at high airmass
* galactic plane no longer at high airmass
* no more u and g in twilight
* Using a TSP solver and avoiding zenith, we reduce the median slewtime


* Weather downtime that better matches downtime of Gemini and SOAR
* Pairs in different filters, so transients have color information
